There once was a girl named Cinderella. She lived in a small village near a beautiful castle. 
Cinderella lived with her mean step-sisters who forced her to do all of the work
around the house. However, there was bright spot in her life. The prince of the castle was 
hosting a ball and she really wanted to attend. She just needed to figure out how she 
was going to get there and what she would wear.

The reality was that she weren't able to find any suitable dress. All the dress she had was dirty.

This didn't stop cinderella however, as she quickly stole some clothes from her ugly stepsisters, and used her tailoring skills 
so that what she stole would not be recognized as something of her stepsisters. Cinderella then snuck out of the house to go to the ball. 

After the ball, Cinderella was accused of stealing by her stepsisters. She was in prison.

In prison, there was a guy in the corner. He was Jack Sparrow who is the piracy and professional at escaping. 
Cinderella helped him to escape the prison and she started her journey at sea. 

Once at sea, Cinderella and Jack Sparrow fall madly in love. Unfortunately, the ship was later ambushed by a different fleet of 
pirate ships and they gave Jack a choice. Either make Cinderella walk the plank or be killed. He decided to make her walk the plank
and the story ends tragically.
