There once was a girl named Cinderella. She lived in a small village near a beautiful castle. 
Cinderella lived with her mean step-sisters who forced her to do all of the work
around the house. However, there was bright spot in her life. The prince of the castle was 
hosting a ball and she really wanted to attend. She just needed to figure out how she 
was going to get there and what she would wear.

The reality was that she weren't able to find any suitable dress. All the dress she had was dirty.

This didn't stop cinderella however, as she quickly stole some clothes from her ugly stepsisters, and used her tailoring skills so that what she stole would not be recognized as something of her stepsisters. Cinderella then snuck out of the house to go to the ball. 

After the ball, Cinderella was accused of stealing by her stepsisters. She was in prison.
