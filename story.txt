There once was a girl named Cinderella. She lived in a small village near a beautiful castle. 
Cinderella lived with her mean step-sisters who forced her to do all of the work
around the house. However, there was bright spot in her life. The prince of the castle was 
hosting a ball and she really wanted to attend. She just needed to figure out how she 
was going to get there and what she would wear.
